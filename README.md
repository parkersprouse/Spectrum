# Spectrum
Spectrum is a puzzle platformer created in Unity. It's a heavy WIP, but it's an idea that I very much want to persue and have a for a long time.<br />
Currently, the only things that are implemented are the movement and collision, a couple of platforms for the first level, and the logic of the characters leaving a trail behind them, and other characters interacting with those trails.
